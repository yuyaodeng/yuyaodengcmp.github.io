  <h1>Yi Shot Down the Suns</h1>  
    <p>According to Chinese Mythologies, in the eastern sea, there was a huge, magic tree named Fu Sang who was over ten thousand feet tall and spread its leaves out over two thousand li (Li is equal to half of kilometer). On it lived the ten sons of the heavenly Emperor. Everyday one of them turned into three-legged crow (In East Asian mythologies the three-legged crow is thought to represent the sun.) and flew up to the sky, illuminating the earth.</p>

    <p>But one day the ten brothers were involved into a heated argument about who was the best son of their father. To show their individual power, they all flew up to the sky and thus cause the earth to scorch. Having failed to order his sons to stop ruining the earth, the Jade Emperor summoned Hou Yi, the god of archery, to discipline his naughty sons.</p>

    <p> When Hou Yi landed on the Earth, seeing all the dead creatures, he was filled with sadness. He called out to the suns and ordered them to stop their foolishness, but they only leaped around the Grand Archer, mocking his seriousness.</p>
    <p>Hou Yi was angry and threatened to shoot them down, but the suns laughed even harder, as they thought that Hou Yi, a heavenly court servant, could do nothing to them.</p>

Quickly, that sun dropped down from the sky, burning up in a ball of fire. The earth immediately felt cooler. Then the Grand Archer stalked the remaining suns.</p>
    
    
    <p>Having witnessed Hou Yi’s powers, the other suns became frightened, and they scattered across the country, trHou Ying to hide. However, one by one, the Grand Archer tracked them down. Each time he killed one of the suns, the earth cooled further.</p>
    
    
    <p>Hou Yi kept shooting until there was only sun left in the sky. Hou Yi warned the last sun to be obedient or dutiful and then went back to the Heavenly kingdom.</p>
    
    
    <p>From then on, the last sun flew across the sky in solitude every day, bringing light and warmth to the Earth for all eternity.</p>

    <h4>Story in Chinese</h4>
    
    <p>传说古时候，天空曾有十个太阳，他们都是东方天帝的儿子。这十个太阳跟他们的母亲、天帝的妻子共同住在东海边上。她经常把十个孩子放在世界最东边的东海洗澡。洗完澡后，让他们像小鸟那样栖息在一棵大树上。因为每个太阳的形象中心都是只鸟，所以大树就成了他们的家，九个太阳栖息在长得较矮的树枝上，另一个太阳则栖息在树梢上。当黎明需要晨光来临时，栖息在树梢的太阳便坐着两轮车，穿越天空，照射人间，把光和热洒遍世界的每个角落。十个太阳每天一换，轮流当值，秩序井然，天地万物一片和谐。人们在大地上生活得非常幸福和睦。人和人像邻居、朋友那样，生活在一起，日出而耕，日落而息，生活过得既美满又幸福。人和动物也能和睦相处。那时候人们感恩于太阳给他们带来了时辰、光明和欢乐，经常面向天空磕头作揖，顶礼膜拜。</p>
    
    <p>可是，这样的日子过长了，这十个太阳就觉得无聊，他们想要一起周游天空，觉得肯定很有趣。于是，当黎明来临时，十个太阳一起爬上双轮车，踏上了穿越天空的征程。这一下，大地上的人和万物就受不了了。十个太阳像十个大火团，他们一起放出的热量烤焦了大地，烧死许许多多的人和动物。森林着火啦，所有的树木庄稼和房子都被烧成了灰烬。那些在大火中没有烧死的人和动物，猪突狼奔，四下流窜，发疯似地寻找可以躲避灾难的地方和能救命的水和食物。</p>
    <p>河流干枯了，大海也面临干涸，所有的鱼类也死光了，水中的怪物便爬上岸偷窃食物。农作物和果园枯萎烧焦，供给人和家畜的食物源断绝了。人们不是被太阳的高温活活烧死就是成了野兽口中食。人们在火海灾难中苦苦挣扎，祈求上苍的恩赐！</p>
    
    <p>这时，有个年轻英俊的英雄大神叫后羿，他是个神箭手，箭法超群，百发百中。他被天帝召唤去，领受了驱赶太阳的使命。他看到人们生活在火难中，心中十分不忍，便暗下决心射掉那多余的九个太阳，帮助人们脱离苦海。</p>
    
    <p>于是，后羿爬过了九十九座高山，迈过了九十九条大河，穿过了九十九个峡谷，来到了东海边，登上了一座大山，山脚下就是茫茫的大海。后羿拉开了万斤力弓弩，搭上千斤重利箭，瞄准天上火辣辣的太阳，嗖地一箭射去，第一太阳被射落了。后羿又拉开弓弩，搭上利箭，嗡地一声射去，同时射落了两个太阳。这下，天上还有七个太阳瞪着红彤彤的眼睛。后羿感到这些太阳仍很焦热，又狠狠地射出了第三枝箭。这一箭射得很有力，一箭射落了四个太阳。其它的太阳吓得全身打颤，团团旋转。就这样，后羿一枝接一枝地把箭射向太阳，无一虚发，射掉了九个太阳。中了箭的九个太阳一个接一个地死去。他们的羽毛纷纷落在地上，他们的光和热一点一点地消失了。直到最后剩下一个太阳，他怕极了，就按照后羿的吩咐，老老实实地为大地和万物继续贡献光和热。</p>
    
    <p>从此，这个太阳每天从东方的海边升起，晚上从西边山上落下，温暖着人间，保持万物生存，人们安居乐业。</p>
